            <p>Only miss the sun when it starts to snow</p>
            <p>Only know you love her when you let her go</p>
            <p>Only know you've been high when you're feeling low</p>
            <p>Only hate the road when you're missing home</p>

            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <p>Staring at the bottom of your glass</p>
            <p>Hoping one day you'll make a dream last</p>
            <p>But dreams come slow and they go so fast</p>
            <p>You see her when you close your eyes</p>
            <p>Maybe one day you'll understand why</p>
            <p>Everything you touch surely dies</p>

             <p>Staring at the ceiling in the dark</p>
             <P>Same old empty feeling in your heart</P>
             <P>'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast</P>
             <p>Well, you see her when you fall asleep</p>
             <p>But never to touch and never to keep</p>
             <p>'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep</p>
